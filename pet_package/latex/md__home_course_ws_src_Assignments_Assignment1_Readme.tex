\subsection*{Introduction}

This assignment target is to build an R\+OS architecture to implement a robot, simulating a pet, that interact with a human and moves in a discrete 2D environment. The pet has three states representing behaviours, that are simulated as a finite state machine with 3 states\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Play
\item Sleep
\item Normal
\end{DoxyItemize}

These states determine the way the robot act inside the grid, whether moving randomly as in normal, going to targets determined by the user or simply sleeping in the home position. The robot will change between states randomly, eccept for play, which is received by the user.

\subsection*{Software Architecture}

The software architecture consists in a pipeline, starting from the command generation and arriving to the pet simulation in turtlesim. Here we show the architecture image\+:

U\+ML scheme. In order to inspect the details, please click on the image 

The main components are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Random command generator(\hyperlink{Command__giver_8py}{Command\+\_\+giver.\+py})\+: send a string representing the concatenation of one or more commands of the form\+: \textquotesingle{}play\textquotesingle{}(to start the play state),\textquotesingle{}point to x y\textquotesingle{}(to simulate the pointing gesture to x y),\textquotesingle{}go to x y\textquotesingle{}(to simulate the voice command to x y)
\item Pet Interpreter(\hyperlink{Pet__logic_8py}{Pet\+\_\+logic.\+py})\+: to interpret the string commands and translate them to a command list
\item Pet behaviours(\hyperlink{Pet__behaviours_8py}{Pet\+\_\+behaviours.\+py})\+: that simulate behaviours as a finite state, in the already mentioned states
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Installation and running procedure}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Download the package from the github repository
\item Set the package in the src folder of the catkin workspace
\item With the shell, get into the folder and run \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}.sh chmod +x launcher.\+sh \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}
\item Write ./launcher.sh
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Working assumptions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The robot, simulating a pet, interact with a human and moves in a discrete 2D environment.
\item Both the robot targets and its positions belongs exclusively to the map(11 by 11 grid)representing the 2D environment.
\item The robot has 3 main states\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Play
\item Normal
\item Sleep
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The robot receive forms in strings with possible form\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}play\char`\"{}
\item \char`\"{}go to x1 y1\char`\"{} (equivalent to voice command)
\item \char`\"{}point to x1 y1\char`\"{} (equivalent to pointing commands)
\item combination of commands with conjuctions of \char`\"{}and\char`\"{}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All the command after the play are executed
\item if a \char`\"{}play\char`\"{} is not in first place, only commands after the \char`\"{}play\char`\"{} command are executed
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The robot can receive any command while executing one in Play state but the ones given are neither executed nor stored.
\item The robot can receive any command while in sleep state but the ones given are neither executed nor stored.
\item Sleep preempt any other state when it starts.
\item From Sleep you can only transition to Normal.
\item The only command that can be received in Normal is \char`\"{}play\char`\"{}.
\item Two predifined positions inside the map are \char`\"{}\+Owner\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Home\char`\"{}, which cannot be changed during the execution, and can be used instead of coordinates in giving commands.
\end{DoxyItemize}
